This is a framework for running the cooking test described in the course.
Using a Makefile makes it a little more convenient to tweak certain steps.
The commands are all basically the same as those given in
/week3/fastTextTutorial.sh.

NOTE:  Some of the fasttext commands have a -thread option that can be used
to speed things up.  That seems like it should make their speed comparable
to the python interface, used in /week3/fastTextTutorial.py, but it does
not seem to have any effect.  Using the python interface appears to be
significantly faster than using the command-line fasttext interface, due to
its ability to be multithreaded.
